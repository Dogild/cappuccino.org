As an open source project, your contributions are important to the
future of Cappuccino. Whether you're looking to write code, add new
documentation, or just report a bug, you'll be helping everyone who uses
Cappuccino in the future.

### Getting the Code

Cappuccino is hosted on
[GitHub](http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino) using the
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) version control system. You can get the code
with the following command:

    git clone git://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino.git

If you don't have Git installed, don't worry, it's simple. Check out the
[official download page](http://git-scm.com/download), or view the
installation guide on the [Git Wiki](http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Installation).

You can also download the latest source code as a [zip
file](http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/zipball/master) or
[tarball](http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/tarball/master). These
links go to the top of the tree, but using GitHub, you can find any
specific revision on any branch and download either file.

For help getting set up with the build tools and checking out the source
code, follow [this guide](http://wiki.github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/getting-and-building-the-source).

### Reporting Bugs <a name="bug-reports">&nbsp;</a>

We use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/issues) to report and
follow bugs in Cappuccino. If you think you've found a problem in
Cappuccino, you can always ask about it on the mailing list or in the
IRC chat room, or you can search GitHub. If you've discovered a new bug,
report it!

### Contributing Code

Patches can either be pasted to [gist](http://gist.github.com/), or you
can simply send us a pull request on GitHub. Patches should conform to
the project's [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) as closely as
possible.

### Documentation, Wiki & Tutorials

Cappuccino documentation is integrated inline with Cappuccino code. We
use a custom documentation generating tool to create the docs on this
site. We'll be making that tool public in the future. If you'd like to
improve the documentation for a given section of the code, you can
as described above and make your
changes. When you're ready, go through the normal commit process to have
your changes integrated with the project.

Github has an [integrated wiki](http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/wikis) which this project
uses for collaboration. We keep a list of projects we think need the
most attention and are worth working on, along with lots of other useful
information for developers. This site also has a [tutorial section](/learn/) where we collect and link to tutorials. If
you've written a tutorial, you can submit a pull request [this site](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino.org) for potential inclusion.
