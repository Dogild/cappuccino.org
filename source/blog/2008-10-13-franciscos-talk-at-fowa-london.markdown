If you were in London last week at the [Future of Web Apps](http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/) conference put on by [Carsonified](http://carsonified.com/), you may have had the opportunity to see our very own Francisco Tolmasky talk about Objective-J, Cappuccino, and, well, the future of web apps.

Thankfully, for those of us who couldn't make it, FOWA has put up a video of the highlights from the talk. Check it out:
