Sofa just released the third version of their award winning point of sale software, [Checkout](http://www.checkoutapp.com/). Chances are if you've ever seen a Mac behind the counter when you've made a purchase, it was running Checkout. Version 3 adds lots of new features, but what's really cool is that they've added a new web component built on top of Cappuccino called [Enstore](http://www.enstore.com/) that allows you to take your physical store and put it completely online. For Enstore, Sofa wanted a truly desktop like experience for managing and creating online stores, and you really have to try it yourself to see how amazing it feels.

From a technology perspective, Enstore is a real milestone as the UI was built almost entirely using [nib2cib](http://wiki.github.com/280north/cappuccino/nib2cib), showing that Cappuccino doesn't just let you build apps faster, but also creates drop dead stunning results.

Klaas Pieter has written up an excellent [blog post](http://www.madebysofa.com/#blog/managing_enstore) about his experiences creating Enstore at Sofa where you can learn more, and a special thanks to him as well for contributing a lot of bug fixes along the way!
