Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

### Cappuccino

##### New features

- The key word `@typedef` has been added to `Objective-j`. This key word allows you to define new types for your application. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2254))

Example :

    :::objj
    @import <Foundation/Foundation.j>

    @typedef NUSuppaType

    @implementation NUMyClass: CPObject
    {
         NUSuppaType mode;
    }
    @end

Objective-j will not raise a warning for the type `NUSuppaType` anymore.

- The `CPTextField` can be used in multiline mode now. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2257))

- The method `addObserverName:object:queue:usingBlock:` has been added to the class `CPNotificationCenter`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2261))

Example :

    :::objj
    var center = [CPNotificationCenter defaultCenter],
        observer = [center addObserverForName:TestNotification
                                       object:anObject
                                        queue:nil
                                   usingBlock:function(notification)
                                   {
                                       notificationCount += 1;
                                   }];

##### Changes/Fixes

- The URL of the current release version of Cappuccino was wrong in the documentation ([zittix](https://github.com/zittix) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2266))

- You can now set a specific height for a `CPTextField` even if a control size is set. ([t00f](https://github.com/t00f) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2258))

- Fixed a binding issue when a `CPArrayController` was bound to a `CPTextField` when you have selected multiple rows. The data of the controller was updated even though no actions were perfomed. ([daboe01](https://github.com/daboe01) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2164))

- In the `JakeFile` template, the configuration build environment parameter could have multiple values, now this variable is well set by detecting the build environment. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2255))

- It's now possible to chain sheet windows in a `CPWindow`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2238))

- When opening a `CPMenu` with items and then opening a `CPMenu` without any items Cappuccino doesn't crash anymore. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2260))
