Today we are very happy announce that Cappuccino 0.9.8 has just been released and it's ready for you to use. This release if focused on stability and bug fixes (~200 bugs squashed) but that doesn't prevent us to deliver some very cool new features.

#### Notable Improvements

- Added the key word **@typdef**

Example:

    :::objj
    @import <Foundation/Foundation.j>

    @typedef NUSuppaType

    @implementation NUMyClass: CPObject
    {
         NUSuppaType mode;
    }
    @end

- Added the implementation of **CFError**, **CPURLErrors** and **CFError**.
- Added support for **multiline CPTextField**.
