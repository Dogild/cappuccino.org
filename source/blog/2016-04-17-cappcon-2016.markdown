### Major releases

Cappuccino 0.9.9 has been released! This release arrives almost exactly a year after the 0.9.8 version and in that year we have been busy. No matter what your Cappuccino app is about, there is something in this release for you. As always the full change log and release notes are available [here](/cappuccino-release-notes.html).

[NUKit](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit), [NUAristo](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit-theme), [Bambou](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/objj-bambou) and [Garuda](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/garuda) have been released by Antoine Mercadal and Christophe Serafin from [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net). This collection of frameworks allows you to easily create a new Cappuccino Application which will communicate with a ReST python server generated by Garuda. And good news, it's lightweight due to the flat theme NUAristo!

[LightObject Framework](https://github.com/mrcarlberg/LightObject) has been released by Martin Carlberg from [Oops](http://www.oops.se). Now you can create your Cappuccino Application model through Xcode. Martin showed this framework communicating with an Objective-J server running on NodeJS during the Cappcon.

### The 31st March 2016

The CappCon 2016 was held at the University Of Liège in Belgium. Around 50 people came for this day and there were talks for everybody - technical talks as well as abstract talks about Cappuccino.

### The Talkers

- [Alexander Ljunberg](https://twitter.com/slevenbits) introduced the audience to Cappuccino and the 0.9.9 release. Nice talk presenting how strong the foundations of Cappuccino are and why this framework was created. You can find the video [here]() as well as the slides used [here]().

- [Antoine Mercadal](https://twitter.com/primalmotion) did a nice demo about the product they are creating at [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net). Nuage Networks took the occasion to release new open source frameworks and Antoine Mercadal showed a demo of these new toys. [NUKit](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit), [NUAristo](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit-theme), [Bambou](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/objj-bambou) and [Garuda](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/garuda)are the frameworks released. You can find the video [here]() as the slides used [here]().

- [Martin Carlberg](https://twitter.com/mrcarlberg) has presented how [Oops](http://www.oops.se) uses Cappuccino. Our Swedish core team member did a demo about the [LightObject Framework](https://github.com/mrcarlberg/LightObject), a Core Data framework for Cappuccino. And interesting fact, the server used for the demo was written in Objective-J and runs on NodeJS. You can find the video [here]() as the slides used [here]().

- [Tim Howell](https://twitter.com/rwelephant) told us his story about Cappuccino and his company [RWElephant](http://www.rwelephant.com). New to Cappuccino and wondering about how difficult it is to use this framework? You should watch this story where Tim explains how he learned Cappuccino and Cocoa during a road trip. You can find the video [here](/downloads/cappCon2016/RWElephant-CappCon2016.pdf) as the slides used [here]().

- [Alexandre Wilhelm](https://twitter.com/wilhelmalex) showed what kind of testing tools Cappuccino provides. If you want to learn more about testing, OJTest, Cucapp or Cucumber you need to watch his talk. You can find the video [here](/downloads/cappCon2016/AlexandreWilhelm-CappCon2016.pdf) as the slides used [here]().

- [Christophe Serafin](https://twitter.com/t00f67) presented tricks and tips for Cappuccino during his talk. What Jake is, how it works, how to organize your project, your xib etc... If you are about to create a new application, you should watch his presentation. You can find the video [here]() as the slides used [here](/downloads/cappCon2016/ChristopheSerafin-CappCon2016.pdf).

### Every good thing has an end

After 8 hours of talking about Cappuccino, it was the time to celebrate this second CappCon! We guess we all agree that Belgium beers have a good reputation (which they deserve) and we hope that everybody had fun during this evening!

We hope that everybody enjoyed this CappCon and had a great time in Belgium!

It was very exciting for us and we hope to organize another CappCon in the future!

To finish , we would like to thanks our sponsors who made this possible! Thank you to [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net), [Oops](http://www.oops.se), [RWElephant](http://www.rwelephant.com) and the [University of Liège](https://www.ulg.ac.be)!
