Today we are very happy announce that Cappuccino 0.9.8 has just been released and it's ready for you to use. This release if focused on stability and bug fixes (~200 bugs squashed) but that doesn't prevent us to deliver some very cool new features:

- Added the key word `@typdef`
- Added support for multiline `CPTextField`.
- Added the implementation of `CFError`, `CPURLErrors` and `CFError`.
- Added `CPControl -setControlSize:`.
- Added all `@protocols` in `Foundation` and in the `AppKit`.
- Added support of `capp_lint` and `objj` to XcodeCapp, which has been bumped to version 3.2.
- Added Cucapp as part of the Cappuccino Project (https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp, thanks [dparnell](https://github.com/dparnell))
- Fixed the theming system to support more than 32 theme states.
- Fixed a huge number of memory leaks in `Foundation` and in `AppKit`.

The full Change Log is available [here](https://github.com/xxxxxxx).
