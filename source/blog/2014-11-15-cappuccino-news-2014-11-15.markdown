Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

### Community

- [Multi-Nib Applications with Interface Builder](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2014/10/multi-nib-applications-with-interface-builder.html) by  Andrew Hankinson has been added to the blog.

### Cappuccino

##### New features

- `xCodeCapp` 3.2. This new version comes with the following features :
    - Each time `xCodeCapp` processes a file, it now launches the command `objj` on the file. This will mainly raise warning issues.
    - The menu `Check Compilation Issues` has been added.
    - The error/warning panel can be configured to stay on the top of your desktop
    - ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) and [primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2248) and [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2253))

- When building your application, you can now disable the `CommonJS` build phase by setting the system environement variable `IGNORE_ENV_COMMONJS`. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2242))

- `.gitignore` now ignores the `.tm_properties`. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/57d435b6db378a1681f861b4f269838e4a5d5d5e))

- New options have been added to the command `objj` :
    - `-h` or `--help` to get the help of the command
    - `-I`or `--objj-include-paths` to specify the frameworks to be used
    - `-m` or `--multifiles` to launch the command on multiple files
    - ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2248))

##### Changes/Fixes

- Old CI scripts have been removed from the Tools directory. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2245))

- `NativeHost` is no longer built by default. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2244))

- The `CPButtonBar` didn't remove old buttons gotm their superview, now it does. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/9a307269ca6d8f7a3c680b5e0fe5d31584857875))

- The `popUpList` of the `CPComboBox` is now added as a `childWindow` of the window of the `CPComboBox`. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/459374db1cf426d82ba22919382645d201bd9c0f))

- Some `APIs` were broken in the `CPComboBox`. You can now set the `font`, `alignment`, `intercellSpacing` and `itemHeight` of the `CPComboBox` without the listDelegate. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/f486c02b5e99c2929e957e6e8548399a375e6f7e))

- The `content-inset` of a `CPComboBox` has been changed for a better alignment. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2251))

- The text cursor of a `CPTextField` didn't take the `content-inset` into account to show up. Now it does like in Cocoa. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2250))

- When moving from a `CPPlatformWindow` to another `CPPlatformWindow`, the new targeted window didn't get the first new `CPEvent`, the previous `CPPlatformWindow` took it. Now it works perfectly. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2256))

- You can now open a `CPPanel` in another `CPPlatformWindow` instead of the main one. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2256))

### Cucapp

##### New features

- `Cucapp` now provides an API to record a set of events and then replay it. This could be very usefull when debugging your application as you won't need to reproduce your actions again and again. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/pull/20))

##### Changes/Fixes

- When using the ruby function `simulate_keyboard_events(string, flags)`, we now make sure to transform the given string in a string object. ([minimilk](https://github.com/minimilk) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/pull/21))

- `Cucapp` now works with the last version of `Thin`, an issue occured when playing tests with a large application. ([little-dude](https://github.com/little-dude) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/pull/22))

- The `CPMouseMoved` events generated by `Cucapp` between two simulated events are now simulated in different stacks, this is closer to a user interaction. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/pull/15))

- The method `find_cucappIdentifier` has been replaced by the method `find_control(aKey, aValue)`. This method prints every controls relative to the given key and value. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/pull/19))

### Work in progress

As you may know, [Apajarita](https://github.com/aparajita) is currently working on the integration of `Cappuccino` and `Node`.
Just to make you dream, this is a sneak peak of the next `objj-compiler`:
