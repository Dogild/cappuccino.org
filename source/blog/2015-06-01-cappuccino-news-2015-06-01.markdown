##### Changes/Fixes

- Fixed: the textual `CPDatePicker` did not respect the english format. ([herbatnik](https://github.com/herbatnik) - [65a379c](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2359))

- Fixed: when compiling cappuccino or an application, the opened file descriptors of the `jake` process were not closed. With large application, the maximum number of open file descriptors of the system was easily reach and made failed the compilation. We now assure to close these file descriptors.
