Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino in the last month.

### Cappuccino

##### Changes/Fixes

- Fixed: optimization with transformation matrix and canvas when using the `Cappuccino` application on an none retina monitor. ([cacaodev](https://github.com/cacaodev) - [c9e83e0](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/c9e83e051763c09e9a3ba5e591b463d5c102b491))

- Fixed: the init method `CPArray initWithObjects:count:` did not work on native `CPJavascriptArray` when the argument count was different than the length of the provided array. ([mrcarlberg](https://github.com/mrcarlberg) - [8599ad4](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/8599ad4a3c38c1030ca9b878e73a25d9e449fa2e))
