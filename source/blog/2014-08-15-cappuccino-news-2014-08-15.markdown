Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

#### Changes/Fixes

##### Cappuccino

- The blurred `CPPopover` animation on Google Chrome has been fixed.

- The transient or semi-transient `CPPopover` close on a right click now.

- The checking of the usability of a `CPTextField` in a `CPPlatformWindow` takes in account the content-inset value of the `CPTextField`.

- The method delegate `- (void)popoverDidShow:(CPPopover)aPopover` is called with a none animated `CPPopover`.

- A memory leaks has been fixed in the `CPOutlineView`. When reloading a `CPOutlineView` with new datas, the class kept a reference of the previous datas.

- The following methods of the `CPOutlineView` don't take care about collapsed or outdated items anymore:
    - `- (BOOL)isExpandable:(id)anItem`
    - `- (BOOL)isItemExpanded:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)rowForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (id)itemAtRow:(CPInteger)aRow`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForRow:(CPInteger)aRow`

##### Cucapp

- The method `def simulate_mouse_moved_on_point x, y, flags` has been added. You can now simulate the event `CPMouseMoved` in your tests.
