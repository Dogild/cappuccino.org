We just shipped another update to the [Atlas Beta today](https://atlas-beta.heroku.com/forums/downloads/topics/atlas-beta-13), and one of the coolest new features is the addition of a plugin API to allow you to create custom controls that you can use as easily as the ones you get by default. To kick this off we've provided a sample plugin for the Google Maps API. You can take a look at what its capable of here:

We've also put together a tutorial (see below) on how we built this plugin so that you can learn to do the same with your code. The MapKit framework and plugin are of course completely open source, so feel free to [take a look](http://github.com/280north/mapkit/)!
