Hi guys,

We are excited to announce that we have launched our Worldwide Cappuccino Meetup [page](http://www.meetup.com/World-Cappuccino-Meetup/).

Meetups are going to be organized regularly throughout the year. We advise you to join this group, you will be informed about any future event we will organize!

The first Meetup will be the CappCon2016 in Li√®ge (Belgium). You can register yourself [here](http://www.meetup.com/World-Cappuccino-Meetup/events/226898401/).

[Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net) will organize meetups every 3-4 months in Mountain View, Califorina. These meetups will cover different themes such as testing, demos, libraries, good practices, etc... The first meetup will be held in mid-April (date to be decided) and Antoine Mercaldal will cover the theme of `Nuage Networks and Cappuccino`.

If you would like to organize a meetup on your own somewhere else, let us know on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cappuccino/cappuccino).

Thanks and see you soon !
