### Cucapp

##### News

- New: added an abstract layer of steps. These steps can be used to quickly and easily write tests in Cucumber, they are totally abstract and can be used for every Cappuccino Application. They provide an API to simulate any actions a user could perform and to check values in the application. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [30786c5](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/commit/30786c56a0af0d81faa8fae9ee575f2fcf9ac0d2))

- New: added ruby methods to generate mouse up and down events. ([william57m](https://github.com/william57m) - [76551a5](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/commit/76551a54b5b23404a0d5dbc8b4d75f08d5cfee6d))

- New: added the environment variable `BROWSER_FULL_SCREEN` to have the browser in full screen when testing. ([william57m](https://github.com/william57m) - [76551a5](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/commit/76551a54b5b23404a0d5dbc8b4d75f08d5cfee6d))

##### Changes/Fixes

- Fixed: refactoring of the class `Encumber`. Drag and drop events are generated from the Cappuccino side, they are now generated from the Cucumber side.  ([william57m](https://github.com/william57m) - [76551a5](https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp/commit/76551a54b5b23404a0d5dbc8b4d75f08d5cfee6d))
