Cappuccino comes preloaded with Aristo, a fresh, bold theme created specifically for the purpose by the exceptional designers at now legendary [Sofa](http://madebysofa.com). Since Aristo's launch in 2009 with Cappuccino 0.7, it has been ported to multiple other UI toolkits, demonstrating its versatile strength.

Two versions of Aristo exist and are included in Cappuccino 0.9.7 and above:

* **Aristo 1** is meant to provide a solid "app" feeling in the browser, and to look good in any browser, whether itâ€™s Firefox, Safari, or even Internet Explorer, Mac and Windows. It's the classic Cappuccino look.

* **Aristo 2** is the successor which provides a lighter more "web-like" look. Built on the desire to "under promise and over deliver", Aristo 2 has a more humble appearance which can serve to make the advanced features of Cappuccino a pleasant surprise while at the same time not carrying over desktop expecations that may not translate well to the browser.
